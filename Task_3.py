# In this file please complete the following task:
#
# Task 3 [6] Cross validation
#
# Evaluate your classifiers using the k-fold cross-validation technique covered in the lectures
# (use the training data only). Output their average precisions, recalls, F-measures and accuracies.
# You need to implement the validation yourself. Remember that folds need to be of roughly equal size.
# The template contains a range of functions you need to implement for this task.
#

# You are expected to rely on solutions from Task_1_5/Task_2 here! Do not reimplement kNN from scratch.
# You can ONLY rely on functions that were originally in the template in your final submission!
# Any functions you have created on your own in these files and need here, must be defined here.

#                             the testing data for that round
